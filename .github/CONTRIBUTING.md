# Contributing

üëç First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üëç

When contributing to this project, please first discuss the change you wish to make in an [Issue](https://github.com/enricodias/smsdev-php/issues/new).

## Coding conventions

-   Use the [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) coding style.
-   Follow the PHPMD and PHPCS rules when possible.
-   Include DocBlocks in new methods, classes and properties.
-   Create the appropriate tests for any new feature.
-   Update the README.md explaining new or modified features.
-   Follow the SOLID principles.

Please note, if your changes are purely to things like README, CHANGELOG etc, you can add ```[skip ci]``` as the last line of your commit message and your PR won't be run through our continuous integration systems. We ask that you use ```[skip ci]``` where appropriate as it helps to get changes through CI faster and doesn't waste resources kindly donated to the Open Source community.

## Guidelines for merging

-   Issue 1 Pull Request per feature. Don't lump unrelated changes together.
-   Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
-   Use the imperative mood ("Change string to..." not "Changes string to...").
-   Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
-   Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.
